I am a researcher at Claudia Maienborn's department for Semantics, Pragmatics, Language and Cognition at the University of Tübingen, Germany. 

My primary research focus is how temporal information is encoded in natural language not just in the verbal but also the nominal domains. In my dissertation project, I developed a formal logic that captures temporality across categories in a uniform fashion. You can find the link to my thesis on the [publications page](https://maximilianaberthold.github.io/publications/).
